# Code of Conduct

PROBPROG is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community experience
for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or

language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including
talks. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled

- Sexual images in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following 
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.
Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.
