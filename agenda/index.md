        <h3>Effective Inference for Probabilistic Programs with Stochastic Support</h3>
        <p>
        Universal probabilistic programming systems allow users to construct
        complex models whose support varies between different executions.
        Unfortunately, this poses a substantial challenge for their underlying
        inference engines, with most common inference schemes not applicable to
        this difficult setting.  In this talk, we will discuss two inference
        schemes for effectively dealing with such problems by decomposing the
        original program into a mixture over sub-programs with static support.  We
        will then show that such programs implicitly define a Bayesian model
        average over paths, and reveal why this can lead to pathologies when
        performing full Bayesian inference. To address this, we will introduce some
        alternative schemes for weighting the different program paths that provide
        more robust prediction under model misspecification.

        <h3>Non-parametric probabilistic programming</h3>
        <p>
        Non-parametric statistics is incredibly expressive (Gaussian
        processes, Dirichlet processes, and beyond). Several authors have proposed
        probabilistic programming as a convenient language for describing
        non-parametric models—more convenient than traditional mathematical
        notation. In this talk I will discuss this, and some recent progress, both
        theoretical and practical.
