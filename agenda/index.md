        <h3>Non-parametric probabilistic programming</h3>
        <p>
        Non-parametric statistics is incredibly expressive (Gaussian
        processes, Dirichlet processes, and beyond). Several authors have proposed
        probabilistic programming as a convenient language for describing
        non-parametric modelsâ€”more convenient than traditional mathematical
        notation. In this talk I will discuss this, and some recent progress, both
        theoretical and practical.
