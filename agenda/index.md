        <h3>ChiRho: A Causal Probabilistic Programming Language</h3>
        <p>
        Despite remarkable progress over the last two decades in reducing
        causal inference to statistical practice, the "causal revolution"
        proclaimed by Judea Pearl and other pioneers remains incomplete,
        with a sprawling and fragmented technical literature that is still
        inaccessible to non-experts and isolated from the cutting-edge
        computational methods and software tools being developed within
        mainstream machine learning research.
        Probabilistic programming languages are promising substrates for
        bridging this gap thanks to the close correspondence between their
        operational semantics and most standard mathematical formalisms for
        causal inference, especially that of structural causal models.
        This talk will introduce ChiRho
        (https://github.com/BasisResearch/chirho), a new causal
        probabilistic programming language embedded in Python. ChiRho
        extends an existing probabilistic programming language (Pyro) that
        is built on algebraic effects and handlers with new algebraic
        operations for performing interventions and counterfactuals on
        causal models represented as probabilistic programs, and new effect
        handlers for automatically reducing causal inference computations
        over these models to ordinary probabilistic computations on
        transformed probabilistic programs. I will also illustrate ChiRho's
        design with representative example applications from econometrics,
        single-cell biology, and epidemiology.

        <h3>Effective Inference for Probabilistic Programs with Stochastic Support</h3>
        <p>
        Universal probabilistic programming systems allow users to construct
        complex models whose support varies between different executions.
        Unfortunately, this poses a substantial challenge for their underlying
        inference engines, with most common inference schemes not applicable to
        this difficult setting.  In this talk, we will discuss two inference
        schemes for effectively dealing with such problems by decomposing the
        original program into a mixture over sub-programs with static support.  We
        will then show that such programs implicitly define a Bayesian model
        average over paths, and reveal why this can lead to pathologies when
        performing full Bayesian inference. To address this, we will introduce some
        alternative schemes for weighting the different program paths that provide
        more robust prediction under model misspecification.

        <h3>Non-parametric probabilistic programming</h3>
        <p>
        Non-parametric statistics is incredibly expressive (Gaussian
        processes, Dirichlet processes, and beyond). Several authors have proposed
        probabilistic programming as a convenient language for describing
        non-parametric modelsâ€”more convenient than traditional mathematical
        notation. In this talk I will discuss this, and some recent progress, both
        theoretical and practical.
