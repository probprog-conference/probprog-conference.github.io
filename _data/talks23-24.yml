  title: Generating Functions for Bayesian Inference on Probabilistic Programs
  abstract: Probability generating functions (PGFs) have recently been applied
    to the analysis of randomized programs. In this talk, I will show that
    they are also useful for Bayesian inference on probabilistc programs.
    The first part of the talk is about exact Bayesian inference for
    discrete models, even with infinite support and continuous priors
    (NeurIPS 2023, oral presentation). The new inference method leverages
    PGFs as a finite representation of such infinite distributions, and
    relies on automatic differentiation to extract information (probability
    masses and moments) from it. This is automated in a tool called Genfer,
    which is competitive with approximate Monte Carlo methods on a range of
    benchmarks, while avoiding approximation errors. In the second part, I
    will discuss ongoing work to extend this to probabilistic programs with
    unbounded loops. Exact inference is very hard to perform exactly, so we
    focus on finding guaranteed bounds on the posterior distribution
    instead. The core idea is to synthesize inductive loop invariants by
    solving systems of polynomial inequalities. If a solution can be found,
    it yields bounds on the probability masses, moments, and tail behavior
    of the program distribution. Our prototype implementation shows
    promising results on several examples from the literature.

  title: 'Coix: A framework for compositional inference with probabilistic programs in JAX'
  abstract: We introduce Coix (https://github.com/jax-ml/coix), a set of program
    transformations for compositional inference with probabilistic programs
    written in common probabilistic programming languages. We provide an
    abstract API that closely follows "Learning proposals for probabilistic
    programs with inference combinators" (Stites et al., 2021). We
    implement backends for NumPyro and Oryx, but the API is easily
    extendable to other PPL backends that can be implemented by the user.
    Finally, we illustrate how to use the API to design modern inference
    algorithms, e.g., instances of "Nested variational inference"
    (Zimmermann et al., 2021), that help approximate complex target
    densities.

  title: Algebraic Program Analysis of Probabilistic Programs
  abstract: Program analysis is a longstanding area about (usually
    automated) techniques for analyzing and proving program properties
    without actually executing the programs. Program analysis of
    probabilistic programs has also received a lot of attention. In this
    talk, we address the question of how to develop a framework that can
    support multiple analyses. We aim to develop an algebraic approach to
    compositional analysis of probabilistic programs, thereby allowing
    program analyses to be designed and implemented by defining appropriate
    semantic algebras. Each semantic algebra consists of (i) a space of
    program properties, and (ii) composition operators that correspond to
    basic program constructs. By using different semantic algebras, one
    implementation of the algebraic framework can implement multiple
    analyses.

  title: Real-Time Open-Ended Goal Inference via Programmable Bayesian Inverse Planning
  abstract: "People routinely infer the goals and intentions of others from both
      actions and words. How might we build assistive machines that do the same?
      This talk will first introduce Bayesian inverse planning as a general
      framework for goal inference. I will then show how these problems can be
      solved accurately and efficiently via Sequential Inverse Plan/Policy Search
      (SIPS), a family of algorithms that model agents as online model-based
      planners, and use programmable sequential Monte Carlo to rapidly infer
      agents' goals and plans from observations of their behavior. Through the
      use of both incremental algorithms and compiler optimizations for
      model-based planning, SIPS can be made to run in (faster than) real-time.
      <br/>
      Because SIPS is implemented using probabilistic programming, it is highly
      configurable. For example, SIPS can be used to model boundedly-rational
      agents, allowing us to infer an agent's goals even when they make planning
      mistakes. SIPS can also handle language input: By using large language
      models (LLMs) as likelihood functions over how people communicate their
      plans in natural language, SIPS can infer human plans from incomplete or
      ambiguous instructions. Finally, SIPS can be integrated with conditional
      priors over human goals that are learned from data, allowing us to scale
      online goal inference to open-ended settings with hundreds of possible
      goals. These advances pave the way towards fast, flexible, and grounded
      inferences over the infinite variety of human goals, furthering the
      development of human-aligned assistive systems."

  title: Smoothness Analysis for Probabilistic Programs
  abstract: "In this talk, we will present a static analysis for discovering
    differentiable (or more generally smooth) parts of a given
    probabilistic program, and show how the analysis can be used to improve
    the pathwise gradient estimator, one of the most popular methods for
    posterior inference and model learning. Our improvement increases the
    scope of the estimator from differentiable models to non-differentiable
    ones without requiring manual intervention of the user: the improved
    estimator automatically identifies differentiable parts of a given
    probabilistic program using our static analysis, and applies the
    pathwise gradient estimator to the identified parts while using a more
    general but less efficient estimator, called score estimator, for the
    rest of the program. Our experiments with representative probabilistic
    programs in the Pyro language show that our static analysis is capable
    of identifying smooth parts of those programs accurately, and making
    our improved pathwise gradient estimator exploit all the opportunities
    for high performance in those programs."

  title: Scaling Probabilistic AI with Automatic Differentiation of Probabilistic Programs
  abstract: By automating the error-prone math behind deep learning, systems such
    as TensorFlow and PyTorch have supercharged machine learning research,
    empowering hundreds of thousands of practitioners to rapidly explore
    the design space of neural network architectures and training
    algorithms. In this talk, I will show how new programming language
    techniques, especially generalizations of automatic differentiation,
    make it possible to generalize and extend such systems to support
    probabilistic models. Our automation is rigorously proven sound using
    new semantic techniques for reasoning compositionally about expressive
    probabilistic programs, and static types are employed to ensure
    important preconditions for soundness, eliminating large classes of
    implementation bugs. Providing a further boost, our tools can help
    users correctly implement fast, low-variance, unbiased estimators of
    gradients and probability densities that are too expensive to compute
    exactly, enabling orders-of-magnitude speedups in downstream
    optimization and inference algorithms.
    <br/>
    To illustrate the value of these techniques, I’ll show how they have
    helped us experiment with new architectures that could address key
    challenges with today’s dominant AI models. In particular, I’ll
    showcase systems we’ve built for (1) auditable reasoning and learning
    in relational domains, enabling the detection of thousands of errors
    across millions of Medicare records, and (2) probabilistic inference
    over large language models, enabling small open models to outperform
    GPT-4 on several constrained generation benchmarks.

  title: Effective Inference for Probabilistic Programs with Stochastic Support
  abstract: Universal probabilistic programming systems allow users to construct complex models whose support varies between different executions. Unfortunately, this poses a substantial challenge for their underlying inference engines, with most common inference schemes not applicable to this difficult setting. In this talk, we will discuss two inference schemes for effectively dealing with such problems by decomposing the original program into a mixture over sub-programs with static support. We will then show that such programs implicitly define a Bayesian model average over paths, and reveal why this can lead to pathologies when performing full Bayesian inference. To address this, we will introduce some alternative schemes for weighting the different program paths that provide more robust prediction under model misspecification.

  title: Non-parametric probabilistic programming
  abstract: Non-parametric statistics is incredibly expressive (Gaussian processes, Dirichlet processes, and beyond). Several authors have proposed probabilistic programming as a convenient language for describing non-parametric models—more convenient than traditional mathematical notation. In this talk I will discuss this, and some recent progress, both theoretical and practical.
