# Call for Submissions

- **Original Deadline**: <span style="color:red"><strike>Jan 10, 2020 11:59 PM AOE</strike></span>
- **Late-breaking Deadline**: <span style="color:red">Mon Sep 14, 2020 11:59 PM AOE 
- **Submit at**: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PROBPROG2020](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PROBPROG2020/)
- **Style Files**: [ZIP](/2020/probprog-2020-style.zip)
- **Overview and Call for Submission**: [PDF](/2020/progprog-2020-submission-guidelines.pdf)

The PROBPROG 2020 conference is seeking two kinds of submissions:

1. **Extended Abstracts**: Authors may submit work in the form of an extended abstract of 2-6 pages for consideration for a poster presentation, talk, or full-length proceedings submission. Extended abstracts are intended as a mechanism for discussing work that may be preliminary, and for this reason are non-archival. Titles for accepted poster presentations and talks will be listed on the conference website. Our aim is to enable researchers to get feedback from the PROBPROG community that helps mature the research, strengthen the probabilistic programming content, and improve the chances of acceptance in top venues aligned with other fields.

2. **Syndicated Submissions**: Authors may submit work that has been accepted for publication in another venue within the last 12 months for consideration as a poster presentation or talk. These submissions may be full-length and are also non-archival, but will be listed on the conference website.

# Late-breaking Submissions

Owing to the fact that there is a 5-month gap between the original conference dates (Apr 23 - 25) and the rescheduled dates (Oct 22 - 24), we would like to invite authors who did not have a chance to submit in January to do so in September.

- Authors of submissions that were previously accepted <ins>need not resubmit this cycle</ins>. 

- Authors of submissions that were <ins>not</ins> accepted are invited to resubmit an updated abstract this cycle.

- We additionally welcome new submissions that were not reviewed in the previous cycle.  

# Update on the Online Probabilistic Programming Journal

We previously announced a new online journal for the probabilistic programming community. This journal will complement existing conferences where probabilistic programming research is routinely published (e.g. the NeurIPS, PLDI, ICML, POPL, UAI, and AISTATS conferences). It is intended as a venue for longer (10-25 page) papers that may require detailed reviews by experts from multiple fields. In addition to novel contributions in the general domain of probabilistic programming, such papers may **(i)** present unifying perspectives on larger research directions in probabilistic programming; **(ii)** present key design insights and implementation details of important probabilistic programming systems; or **(iii)** present in-depth tutorials on techniques and applications that could be important to practitioners.

After considerable deliberation, we have decided to delay the launch of this journal. The 2020 year has brought unprecedented global crises and the opportunity for lasting social change. Some members of our community have been involved in urgently needed activism and in COVID19 modeling. All members have been deeply affected by the crises, and many members’ professional activities have been significantly curtailed. Community bandwidth for reviewing papers and editing journals has, quite understandably, been especially reduced. We will continue working on assembling the PROBPROG steering committee and editorial board members needed to sustain the conference and journal for its initial years. As soon as our organization is ready, we will announce new launch dates and journal structure to the community.
