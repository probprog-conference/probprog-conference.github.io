The PROBPROG 2021 conference is seeking two kinds of submissions:

1. **Extended Abstracts**: Authors may submit work in the form of an extended abstract of 2-6 pages for consideration for a poster presentation, talk, or full-length proceedings submission. Extended abstracts are intended as a mechanism for discussing work that may be preliminary, and for this reason are non-archival. Titles for accepted poster presentations and talks will be listed on the conference website. 

2. **Syndicated Submissions**: Authors may submit work that has been accepted for publication in another venue within the last 12 months for consideration as a poster presentation or talk. These submissions may be full-length and are also non-archival, but will be listed on the conference website.
