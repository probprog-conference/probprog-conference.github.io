<p>PROBPROG 2021 is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is
not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference
participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from
the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference
organizers.</p>

<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.</li>
  <li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
  <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
  <li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
  <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
  <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
  <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
  <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.
Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.</p>

<h2 id="anonymous-reporting">Anonymous Reporting</h2>
