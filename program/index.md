# Dates and Location

- **Conference Dates**: Fall 2020 (previously Apr 23 – 25 2020)
- **Conference Location**: MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA
- **Submission Deadline**: <span style="color:red"><strike>Jan 10, 2020 11:59 PM AOE</strike></span> 

The second *International Conference on Probabilistic Programming (PROBPROG)* was originally scheduled be held in Cambridge, MA on Thursday April 23, Friday April 24, and Saturday April 25. 

In response to growing public health concerns surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, we have decided to postpone PROBPROG 2020 to a date in Fall 2020. This decision reflects our best judgement as conference organizers, as well as [policies](https://medical.mit.edu/news/2020/01/2019-novel-coronavirus-updates-1) set by MIT. We are currently hard at work to determine what dates will be most suitable for a Fall conference. Further communication will follow once dates have been confirmed. 

# Program Overview

- **Thursday (date TBD)**: Industry day, Tutorials, and Open-Source Meetup
- **Friday (date TBD)**: Main conference
- **Saturday (date TBD)**: Main conference

Probabilistic programming is an emergent field based on the idea that
probabilistic models can be efficiently represented as executable
code. This idea has enabled researchers to formalize, automate, and
scale up many aspects of modeling and inference; to make modeling and
inference accessible to a broader audience of developers and domain
experts; and to develop new programmable AI systems that integrate
modeling and inference approaches from multiple domains.

PROBPROG is the first international conference dedicated to
probabilistic programming. PROBPROG includes presentations on basic
research, applied research, open source, and the practice of
probabilistic programming. PROBPROG attendees come from academia,
industry, non-profits, and government. The conference aims to achieve
three goals:

1. **Create a venue where researchers from multiple fields** —
e.g. programming languages, statistics, machine learning, and
artificial intelligence — can meet, interact, and exchange ideas.

2. **Grow a diverse and inclusive probabilistic programming
community**, by actively seeking participation from under-represented
groups, and providing networking opportunities, mentorship, and
feedback to all members.

3. **Support the development of the practice of probabilistic
programming**, including open-source systems and real-world
applications, and provide a bridge between the practice of
probabilistic programming and basic research.

PROBPROG welcomes abstract submissions for contributed research
presentations, demonstrations, open-source systems, participants in
open discussions, and consideration for invited publication in an
online journal. Submissions should indicate alignment with one or more
of the following themes:

1. **Artificial and Natural Intelligence.** Probabilistic programs
and probabilistic programming technology for formulating and solving
the core problems of intelligence, including research relevant for
engineering artificial intelligence and for reverse-engineering
natural intelligence. A central theme in this track is new AI
architectures based on probabilistic programming that integrate
statistical, symbolic, neural, Bayesian, and simulation-based
approaches to knowledge representation and learning. Another central
theme is proposals for learning probabilistic programs from data, and
modeling high-level forms of human learning using probabilistic
program synthesis. This track also includes research at the
intersection of probabilistic programming and intelligence
augmentation, collective intelligence, machine learning, and the
development and analysis of intelligent infrastructure.

2. **Statistics and Data Analysis.** Probabilistic programs and
probabilistic programming technology for formulating and solving
problems in statistics and data analysis. Topics include latent
variable models, parameter estimation, automated data modeling,
Bayesian inference, calibration, model checking, model criticism,
visualization, and testing of statistical models and inference
algorithms. This track also includes statistical applications and
deployments of probabilistic programming for data analysis.

3. **Languages, Tools, and Systems.** The design, implementation, and
formal semantics of probabilistic programming languages and systems,
including domain-specific and general-purpose languages, interpreters,
compilers, probabilistic meta-programming techniques, probabilistic
meta-programming languages, and runtime systems. This track also
includes research on dynamic and static analysis of probabilistic
programs, and empirical and theoretical study of the usability,
performance, and accuracy of probabilistic programming languages and
systems.

4. **The Practice of Probabilistic Programming.** This track is
centered on four themes: **(i)** probabilistic programs and systems
based on probabilistic programming that solve problems in industry,
government, philanthropic work, applied research, and teaching, as
well as potential use cases for probabilistic programs or
probabilistic programming technology in these areas; **(ii)**
challenges that arise when using probabilistic programming in
practice, including inspection, debugging, testing, and performance
engineering; **(iii)** human-centric design of probabilistic programs
and probabilistic programming technology; and **(iv)** probabilistic
programming tools, probabilistic program analyses, probabilistic
programming styles/workflows, probabilistic programming
practices/guidelines/experience reports, and probabilistic programming
environments with the potential to address issues faced by
practitioners.

# Call for Submissions

- **Deadline**: <span style="color:red"><strike>Jan 10, 2020 11:59 PM AOE</strike></span> 
- **Submit at**: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PROBPROG2020](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PROBPROG2020/)
- **Style Files**: [ZIP](/2020/probprog-2020-style.zip)
- **Overview and Call for Submission**: [PDF](/2020/progprog-2020-submission-guidelines.pdf)

The PROBPROG 2020 conference is seeking two kinds of submissions:

1. Extended Abstracts: Authors may submit work in the form of an
extended abstract of 2-6 pages for consideration for a poster
presentation, talk, or full-length proceedings submission. Extended
abstracts are intended as a mechanism for discussing work that may be
preliminary, and for this reason are non-archival. Titles for accepted
poster presentations and talks will be listed on the conference
website. Our aim is to enable researchers to get feedback from the
PROBPROG community that helps mature the research, strengthen the
probabilistic programming content, and improve the chances of
acceptance in top venues aligned with other fields.

2. Syndicated Submissions: Authors may submit work that has been
accepted for publication in another venue within the last 12 months
for consideration as a poster presentation or talk. These submissions
may be full-length and are also non-archival, but will be listed on
the conference website.

Authors should indicate if they would like their submission to be
considered for invitation by the online Probabilistic Programming
journal.

# Online Probabilistic Programming Journal

PROBPROG is a cross-disciplinary venue that aims to balance three goals:

Probabilistic programming conference papers are often accepted at top
research conferences, e.g. NeurIPS, AISTATS, ICML, UAI, PLDI, and
POPL. However, there is no existing venue for longer (10-25 page)
papers, that may require detailed reviews by experts from multiple
fields. In addition to novel contributions in the general domain of
probabilistic programming, such papers may **(i)** present unifying
perspectives on larger research directions in probabilistic
programming; **(ii)** present key design insights and implementation
details of important probabilistic programming systems; or **(iii)**
present in-depth tutorials on techniques and applications that could
be important to practitioners.

Probabilistic Programming is a new online journal, published
concurrently with the PROBPROG conference. Probabilistic Programming
aims to foster the development of probabilistic programming as an
intellectual activity, and educate the growing community of
probabilistic programming researchers and practitioners. This year, a
subset of PROBPROG abstracts will be invited to be expanded into
articles in the inaugural issue of Probabilistic
Programming. Submissions should indicate if they would like to be
considered for these invitations.

# Diversity

We are actively working to ensure that the PROBPROG conference is
inclusive in the broadest sense. In particular, we encourage
contributions from participants whose gender, sexual orientation,
and/or ethnic identities are underrepresented in the field.

We welcome feedback from the community on policies and measures that
help establish a venue that is welcoming to all participants. Please
direct such suggestions and comments to
[probprog-chairs@googlegroups.com](probprog-chairs@googlegroups.com).

# Sponsorship
