# PROBPROG 2023 Fall Seminar Series

The International Conference on Probabilistic Programming (PROBPROG) is
pleased to announce the start of a new **_Seminar Series in Probabilistic
Programming_**, to be held monthly in Fall 2023.

Probabilistic programming is an emergent field based on the idea that rich
probabilistic models can be efficiently represented as programs in
specialized programming languages. This idea has enabled researchers to
formalize, automate, and scale up many aspects of modeling and inference;
to make modeling and inference accessible to a broader audience of
developers and domain experts; and to develop new programmable AI systems
that integrate diverse modeling and inference approaches.

The Seminar series will serve as a platform for bringing together
researchers and practitioners in probabilistic programming, statistics,
ML/AI, and adjacent areas, to advance all aspects of probabilistic
modeling, inference, and languages.  Invited speakers will have the
opportunity to update the broader community about their latest work.  The
seminar will additionally provide a venue for participants in academia and
industry to exchange ideas, experiences, problem domains, and cutting-edge
software projects through a breakout room format with open discussion.

## Dates

The Fall 2023 schedule is as follows (held via GatherTown, link TBA):

- Thu Sep 28, 2023. 11:00 am - 12:30 pm US ET
- Thu Oct 26, 2023. 11:00 am - 12:30 pm US ET
- Thu Nov 30, 2023. 11:00 am - 12:30 pm US ET
- Thu Dec 21, 2023. 11:00 am - 12:30 pm US ET

## Submission Tracks

We are soliciting submissions for talks in three tracks.

1. **Probabilistic Programming Research Talks**.
Talks in this track present novel research that has already been accepted
at a peer-reviewed venue (e.g., PLDI, NeurIPS, POPL, AISTATS, OOPSLA, ICML
etc.) within the last 18 months.  Authors should submit the abstract and
full paper of the accepted paper as PDF, specifying the original venue and
date of the paper's acceptance. Slides from previous iterations of the talk
may be optionally submitted as well.

2. **Probabilistic Programming in Practice Talks**.
Talks in this track are focused on demos for systems, languages, and
applications of probabilistic programming in practice.  Authors should
submit a summary describing the main capabilities and/or applications of
the system being presented.  Preference will be given to submissions that
are associated with high-quality open-source demos (e.g. Github repository,
online tutorials, IPython notebooks, etc.) that can be presented in the
seminar. Examples of supporting materials are given on the submission form.

3. **Discussion Topic Proposal**.
This track invites proposals for a discussion topic in a community breakout
room.  Proposed topics may be associated with preliminary work (e.g.,
workshop papers, arXiv preprint) to help ground the discussion.
Submissions are strongly encouraged to include more than one person per
topic, including a designated moderator.  Preferences will be given to
submissions that include a clear problem statement and supporting
discussion materials.

## Submissions

Please complete the form on the [submissions page](/submit/).
Submissions will be accepted on a rolling basis.
